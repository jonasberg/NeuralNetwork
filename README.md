# Neural Network 

This is a project written for the purpose of learning the mathematical details of neural networks, including how to form predictions, backpropagation and optimization of the network. The code is functional, but by no means optimized and should not be used for any other purposes than educational ones.

## Overview

The base class with which to interact with is `NeuralNetwork`, 

## Known issues / Further improvements

**Improvements**

* Implement training history of optimizers to be able to visualize the training progress of the models and compare the performance of different optimizers.
